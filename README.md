# Tether your Droid to an Arch machine

I've yanked this code from a chap named [Shannon
VanWagner](www.humans-enabled.com). This is by-and-large his code; I've only
made modifications necessary to retrofit the code to Arch and some cosmetic
ones for my own sanity. He seems like a freetard so he probably won't care
that I'm redistributing it like this.

## Using it

1. Read the code. Understand it. Modify it; you'll need to.
2. Run it with `sudo`.
